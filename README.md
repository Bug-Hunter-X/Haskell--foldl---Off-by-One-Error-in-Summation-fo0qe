# Haskell `foldl'` Summation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `foldl'` function in Haskell to calculate the sum of a list. The issue lies in providing an incorrect initial value, resulting in an off-by-one error.

The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code. The correct implementation is provided in `bugSolution.hs`.

This example highlights the importance of careful consideration of initial values when using fold functions.
